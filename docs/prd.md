### **Project Requirements Document: URL Shortener Service**

*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** September 27, 2025

#### **1. Vision & Business Goals**

**1.1. Vision**
To create a high-performance, reliable, and scalable URL shortening service that simplifies link sharing for casual users while providing powerful analytics and brand management tools for professional and enterprise clients.

**1.2. Business Goals**
*   **Goal 1:** Launch a core, highly-reliable URL shortening and redirection service (MVP).
*   **Goal 2:** Attract power users and businesses through value-added features like custom links and analytics.
*   **Goal 3:** Establish a platform that can be monetized in the future through premium features and API access tiers.

#### **2. User Personas & Scenarios**

**2.1. Persona 1: The Casual User (Anonymous)**
*   **Description:** An individual who occasionally needs to shorten a long link to share in an email, social media post, or instant message.
*   **Needs:** A fast, simple, and free way to shorten a URL without registration.
*   **Scenario:** Alice finds a long, complex URL for a news article she wants to share with a friend on a messaging app. She visits the service's homepage, pastes the long URL, gets a short link instantly, and shares it.

**2.2. Persona 2: The Social Media Manager (Registered User)**
*   **Description:** A marketing professional who manages brand presence across multiple platforms. They need to track campaign performance and maintain brand consistency.
*   **Needs:** Custom-branded short links, analytics on link clicks, and a dashboard to manage all their links.
*   **Scenario:** Bob is running a marketing campaign for a new product. He creates several custom short URLs (e.g., `brand.ly/new-product-fb`, `brand.ly/new-product-tw`) and uses them in different social media posts. He then logs into his dashboard to compare the click-through rates from Facebook versus Twitter.

**2.3. Persona 3: The Developer (API User)**
*   **Description:** A software developer integrating URL shortening into their own application (e.g., a content publishing platform, a mobile app).
*   **Needs:** A well-documented, reliable, and fast REST API to create and manage links programmatically.
*   **Scenario:** Carol is building a social media scheduling tool. When her app's user composes a post with a link, her backend service makes an API call to the URL shortener to get a short link before publishing the post.

#### **3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

Features are prioritized as: **P0 (Must-Have)**, **P1 (Should-Have)**, **P2 (Could-Have)**.

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Functionality** |
| FR1 | **Short URL Generation** | As a user, I can submit a long URL and receive a unique, randomly generated short URL. | P0 |
| FR2 | **URL Redirection** | As a user, when I access a short URL, I am immediately and correctly redirected to the original long URL. | P0 |
| **User & API Features** |
| FR3 | **Custom URL Alias** | As a **Registered User**, I can specify a custom alias for my short URL (e.g., `short.url/my-event`). | P1 |
| FR4 | **Basic Click Analytics** | As a **Registered User**, I can view the total number of clicks for each of my short links. | P1 |
| FR5 | **User Registration & Login** | As a user, I can create an account and log in to manage my links and view analytics. | P1 |
| FR6 | **API Key Generation** | As a **Developer**, I can generate and manage API keys from my account dashboard to authenticate API requests. | P1 |
| FR7 | **Public API Endpoint** | As a **Developer**, I can programmatically create short URLs via a public REST API. | P1 |
| **System Features** |
| FR8 | **Link Expiration** | As a **Registered User**, I can set an optional expiration date and time for a short URL. | P2 |
| FR9 | **Malicious Link Prevention** | The system should check submitted URLs against a known database of malicious sites to prevent abuse. | P1 |
| FR10 | **Link Management Dashboard** | As a **Registered User**, I can view, search, and delete all the links I have created. | P2 |


#### **4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

| ID | Requirement | Description & Success Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** |
| NFR1 | **Redirection Latency** | The time from a user hitting a short URL to the HTTP 302 redirect response being issued. **Metric:** 99th percentile (p99) latency < 50 milliseconds. |
| NFR2 | **Creation Latency** | The time taken to create a new short URL via the API or website. **Metric:** 95th percentile (p95) latency < 200 milliseconds. |
| **Availability** |
| NFR3 | **Redirection Service Uptime** | The URL redirection functionality must be highly available. **Metric:** 99.95% uptime (less than 22 minutes of downtime per month). |
| NFR4 | **Creation Service Uptime** | The API and web interface for creating links must be available. **Metric:** 99.9% uptime (less than 44 minutes of downtime per month). |
| **Scalability** |
| NFR5 | **Read/Write Throughput** | The system must be able to handle the projected load without performance degradation. **Metric:** Sustain 20,000 redirection RPS and 1,000 creation RPS. |
| **Security** |
| NFR6 | **Data Protection** | All user data (passwords, API keys) must be stored securely. **Metric:** Passwords hashed, API keys encrypted at rest. All traffic must use HTTPS. |
| NFR7 | **Predictability** | The generated short URLs must not be sequential or easily guessable. **Metric:** Short URLs must be generated from a non-sequential, sufficiently large keyspace (Base62 or similar). |
| **Durability & Reliability** |
| NFR8 | **Data Durability** | Created links must not be lost. **Metric:** The system should have a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of less than 1 hour. Automated backups must be in place. |


#### **5. Out of Scope**

To ensure a timely and focused initial launch, the following features will **not** be included in the first version:
*   Editing a long URL after a short link has been created.
*   Detailed analytics (e.g., geographic location of clicks, referrers, unique vs. total clicks).
*   QR code generation for short links.
*   Multiple user accounts under a single organization.
*   Different API Tiers (e.g., rate-limiting for free vs. paid users).
*   A dedicated analytics dashboard with charts and graphs.
